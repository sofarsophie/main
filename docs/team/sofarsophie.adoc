=== Enhancement Added: Enhance `FindCommand`

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

---

==== Justification

The `find` command allows the user to find the client or colleague that matches the information that they have. So the user
can quickly locate a contact with little information. For instance, a user may have an unknown phone number on their phone.
The user can use the `find` command to find whose number it is. Also, a user may wish to find out how many of their clients
live in a specific neighbourhood, to plan their door-to-door selling dates.

==== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=find]

=== Enhancement Added: Add command `sort`

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

---

==== Justification

The target user of this application are typically likely to have many contacts on their address book. The sort command is essential
for the user to neatly organize their list of contacts based on any field. For instance, an insurance seller using this address book may
wish to see how many of their clients are stores or organizations. The user can simply sort their address book by phone number, which will
place all the contacts with number starting with 6 at the top.

==== Implementation
